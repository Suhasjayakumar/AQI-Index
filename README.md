Project Overview
This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data across India over a ten-year period from 2016 to 2025. The goal is to transform large volumes of raw air quality data into meaningful insights through interactive visualizations, enabling better understanding of pollution trends, dominant pollutants, and high-risk regions.
The dashboard supports year-wise, state-wise, and city-wise analysis and highlights both long-term trends and current-year air qualit conditions.

#Objectives
Analyze air quality trends in India from 2016 to 2025
Identify cities and states with consistently high AQI levels
Determine the most dominant air pollutants
Visualize seasonal and long-term AQI patterns
Enable interactive data exploration for informed decision-making

#Key Insights
Air quality in India shows persistent pollution patterns over the last decade
Particulate matter, especially PM10 and PM2.5, is the primary contributor to poor air quality
Urban and industrial regions consistently record higher AQI values
Seasonal variations significantly influence AQI trends

#Challenges Addressed
Handling large, multi-year datasets
Cleaning missing and inconsistent AQI values
Optimizing dashboard performance
Designing clear and intuitive visualizations
